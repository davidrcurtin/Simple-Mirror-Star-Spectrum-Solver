# Simple-Mirror-Star-Spectrum-Solver
(c) Jack Setford, 2021


This is a Mathematica code to estimate the thermal and X-ray spectrum of atomic dark matter mirror stars that capture SM matter via a small dark photon kinetic mixing.

These calculations are based on the SHORT paper that introduced mirror stars and calculated their signatures arising from capturing SM matter in their cores:

Please cite both papers if you use this code in your own research. 

This code uses the faster estimation methods of the short paper to drastically speed up computation time, which is suitable for estimating mirror star signatures at the order-of-magnitude level for flux and within a factor of < ~ 2 for frequency cutoffs and peaks over a wide range of possible mirror star and atomic dark matter parameters.
